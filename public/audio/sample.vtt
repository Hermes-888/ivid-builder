00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The year was 2015, and food workers
in the meat and bakery departments were busy. 

1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The meat employees were mixing raw pork sausage.

2
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The bakery workers were preparing a batch
of delicious chocolate mousse cake.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Together, the team fulfilled all its orders.

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Another successful day at work.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.767
or was it?

6
00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:27.200
Over the next few weeks, 16 people tested positive for E. coli infection. 

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.100
Another nine reported symptoms.

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.533
The health department investigation confirmed
that the chocolate mousse cake was to blame.

9
00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.533
So what happened? 

10
00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:40.734
How did E. coli bacteria get into the cake? 

11
00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:42.967
Write your thoughts in the box below.

12
00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:47.166
If you need a hint, just let us know!

13
00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:52.700
Did you notice that the bakery workers
used the same mixer as the meat department employees? 

14
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.233
The raw pork probably left E. coli bacteria in the mixer, 

15
00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.734
which spread to the chocolate mousse when the bakers borrowed it.

16
00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:05.567
The mousse wasn't cooked to a hot enough temperature to kill E. coli, 

17
00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:11.233
so the germs survived and made 25 chocolate lovers sick.

18
00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:15.330
E. coli are a common cause of food poisoning. 

19
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.500
Most people recover after a few days, 

20
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.166
but in rare cases a serious complication causes
the kidneys to stop working.

21
00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:31.266
As a food worker, it's part of your job to prevent food hazards like this.
